#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with  the designing, development,testing and maintanance of high quality software applications.
it helps in improving quality,budget and time efficiency of a software to meet the required qualities. eg in communication,  healthcare and e-commerce.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the rise of programming languages such as codes
2. Artificial inteligence application in software development
3. cloud computing

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - it involves defining the purpose of the purpose of the software and the pointing out the route to take for its development
2. requirement analysis involves analysing the requirements or inteneded purpose of the software by the end user.
3. designing- building the software framework outlining the structure, navigation, user-interface and database design
4. coding- converting the software design into tangible codes
5. tersting- examination of the software for any bugs and glitches that may have slipped in during coding to ensure proper running.
6. deployment- presenting the software to the end user ensuring they can operate with ease by offering support and training if need be.
7. maintanance- constant assistance and improvement odf the software to ensure it meets long term functionality to meet the customers need and expectations
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is is a linear model where you have to end one phase before proceeding to the next eg a shopping app
Agile methodology breaks down the development phase into several dynamic phases focusing on the continous improvement.eg scrum, extreme programing, adaptive software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
softare developers use their programming language and tools to design, build, test and deploy softwares
QAE oversees the softwares before they are deployed to the end users ensuring that they meet the quality and requirements intended.
Project managersassign roles and tasks to the team and provide guidance throughout the development of the software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs helps the programmers develop a software code efficiently by combining capabilities such as editing, building, testing, debugging in an easy way ie consolidates them all together.eg source- code, compiler, debugger and syntax highlighting.

VCS helps to are used to show the team the progress visually without having to read through the to do lists, its easier and fast eg the kanban board.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Time constarints from some clients
2. Limited resources
3. Growing customer demands in the development stage.
4. Rapid advancement in technology
5. conflicting requirements
6. undefined system boundaries
7. inadequate testing and debuging 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- this is testing in every unit of the software to ensure that they all run without bugs and also to ensure that an added code do not interfere with the running of the software
Intergration testing is done after unit testing to ensure that different units work properly when put together as intended to produce an output.
system output evaluates the overall functionality and perfomance  of the whole software to ensure it that it meets the requirements and expectations of the end user an is ready for delivery.
Acceptance testing is the last and formal testing done according to the users needs and requirements to determine whether the software satisfies the acceptance criteria to enable the user to accept that the software meets their requirement.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt ingeneering is the art process of structuring clear instructions that can be interpreted by a generative AI model to give the expected or high quality results.
It helps minimise bias info by human and also helps bridge the gap to information in an easier and fast manner.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague- importance of embracing technology
improved- Assuming that you are in an interview, discusss he importance of embracing technology giving scenarios of how it will improve lives, give examples for the same.
